const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How long will it take for my carpet to dry?',
    answer: 'It usually takes 3-4 hours for a carpet to dry completely in the summer time, but it could take up to 24 hours in the colder months! This is all dependant on the humidity, temperature, air circulation etc, as the air is damp! Drying times can be accelerated by using dehumidifiers, turbo dryers, heating and other factors. Please make sure there is ample air circulation for your carpets to dry properly, otherwise you may end up with a dusty, stagnant smell. This can also occur if you put furniture back too soon and trap moisture!'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer an end of tenancy carpet cleaning service?',
    answer: 'Yes! We can certainly provide an end of tenancy carpet cleaning services. A full house carpet clean deal can be offered at a reduced price and a certificate is given to the tenant to produce to the agent or property owner.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should I have my carpets cleaned?',
    answer: 'For best results, you should have your carpets cleaned every 12 months. This will help prolong the life of your carpet and help with allergens. You should also clean stains and spills immediately.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you guarantee stain removal?',
    answer: 'We can never guarantee stain removal! This is due to various factors such as how long the stain has been there, the nature of the stain, whether or not the customer has attempted DIY with shop-bought products. We can\'t guarantee complete removal, but with professional chemicals, equipment and training, we definitely give a 100% effort.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can traffic areas be cleaned so they are not visible?',
    answer: 'If the carpet is heavily soiled and worn it can be improved, but the chances are that the carpet fibres will have been damaged and therefore the traffic area will remain to some degree. If the carpet is in good condition, they can be removed. Soiled areas with high traffic causes the carpets to grey or darken by abrasion and the colour is worn from the carpet. This is called carpet greying.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How can carpet cleaning aid my health?',
    answer: 'Carpets can retain many pollutants such as dirt, dust, pet dander and dust mites, just to name a few. If a member of your household suffers from asthma, it is highly recommended to keep your carpets clean due to the above factors. Clean carpets will also aid air circulation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long will it take to clean my carpet?',
    answer: 'The time it takes to clean your carpet depends on the carpet\'s density, how soiled it is and the size of the area being cleaned. A standard-sized room of 4x3m usually takes around 1 hour - 1.5 hours. This includes setup and clear away.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I walk on my carpet while it\'s still damp?',
    answer: 'Yes, you can walk on damp carpet with bare feet or socks, but you should avoid wearing shoes or letting pets walk on it until it\'s completely dry. This is because during its drying stage, the carpets will be slightly tacky, thus allowing dirt to re-soil the carpet quicker! Please be mindful of slipping hazards when stepping from damp carpet onto slick surfaces such as hardwood, linoleum or tile.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my carpet shrink during cleaning?',
    answer: 'Carpets will only shrink if too much heat or cleaning solution is used (over-wetting). Please be advised that shrinking is more prominent in Wilton carpets. The carpet cleaning technician will do a check prior to the clean to determine what fibre you have and treat accordingly!'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do I have a stagnant/fusty smell a day or so after my carpets were cleaned?',
    answer: 'The main cause of this is due to customers putting their furniture back before the carpet has fully dried out, thus trapping moisture. The other reason is poor air circulation. It is highly recommended to let the carpet fully dry out and to open windows or put your heating on after a clean. Failure to do this will result in a stagnant, fusty smell occurring!'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are you a franchised company?',
    answer: 'No, I am a sole trader. The majority of my work comes from customer recommendations. I am able to bring you cheaper prices, due to the fact that I am a sole trader and don\'t have employees\' wages to pay.'
